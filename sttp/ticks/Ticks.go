// that have elapsed since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 UTC, Gregorian calendar. A single tick represents one hundred
// nanoseconds, or one ten-millionth of a second. There are 10,000 ticks in a millisecond and 10 million ticks in a second.
// Only bits 01 to 62 (0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) are used to represent the timestamp value. Bit 64 (0x8000000000000000) is used
// to denote leap second, i.e., second 60, where actual second value would remain at 59. Bit 63 is reserved and unset.
